First needed to install Cypress itself with 

npm install --save-dev cypress

(takes a few minutes).

Then initialize it for using the first time with

npx cypress open


Later to create and run the tests, made a test file in the folder


We can run the tests with the command: npx cypress open and then choosing the testing file OR simply run " npx cypress run --spec "name of the test file.js"  "


Now talking about the tests, here's what they do 1 by 1, starting with the first one:


Test 1: Main Page Structure Validation
Checks that all UI elements are present and visible including header with "WELCOME TO MOONEY'S" text, 
search section with proper heading and input placeholder, search button, 
filter controls (price from/to inputs, cover type dropdown, author field, description field), book list header, and footer with copyright notice. Waits for loading to complete before validation.

Test 2: Title Search Functionality
Tests the search feature by dynamically extracting the first word from an existing book's title, entering it in the search field, 
submitting the form, and verifying that all returned results contain the searched term. 
Also tests the no-results scenario by searching for "NonExistentBook123" and confirming the "No books found matching your criteria" message appears.

Test 3: Advanced Filtering System
Tests all filter options systematically: selects "Hardcover" from cover dropdown and verifies only hardcover books display, 
extracts author name from first book and filters by it, sets price range ($10-$50) and validates results fall within bounds using parseFloat validation, 
sets page count range (100-500) and checks numeric values, and searches for "book" in descriptions using case-insensitive regex matching. Resets filters between tests to ensure clean state.
